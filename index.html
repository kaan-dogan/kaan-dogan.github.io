            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there, I'm Kaan, born in 2007 in Ankara, Turkey. When I was 13, my family and I made the move to the awesome city of Edinburgh because of my dad's work. Right now, I'm navigating high school life at Broughton High School. <br><br>
                I'm into coding and can handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pretty well. I've dabbled a bit in C# and feel pretty confident with Python. Oh, and I can switch between Turkish and English without missing a beat. <br><br>
                Artificial Intelligence is one of the things that busy my mind lately, I am so curious about how it works and what can be done with it, looking back at what has been done with it I can see there is actually no limit, the developers behind the magnificent chatGPT were people like me at some point, interested, excited teenagers who want to change the world, make human lives easier, who knows, maybe 20 years later someone will write the same words for me and other developers, another teenager who was amazed by what I did and excited about what they could.<br><br>
                Outside of the classroom, you might find me swimming in a pool or playing table tennis with a stranger, or maybe in my room, coding this website or something similar, take a look at my projects <a href="#projects">down here!</a></p>

                    <p>I crafted a comprehensive website during class, featuring four cuisines, each with multiple sub-pages. Additionally, there's a survey page for user feedback.
